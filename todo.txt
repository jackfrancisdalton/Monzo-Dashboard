Real Data
- Set up monzo auth and token storage for real monzo api
- Set up initial data fetch of Balances, Transactions, Accounts
- Set up DB to store data and insert
- Arch/Decide method for updating data on the go options considered atm
-- polling (refresh data every X hours)
-- webhook (have webhook attached to the)
- Set up merchant scraping (merchant data and address not provided in list transactions by default)
-- on webhook or on polling build a map of all transactions with no merchant stored
-- fetch transaction and (including `expand merchant`) and store merchant full data in db

Set up/Welcome Page
1. show if no tokens are in the database (suggesting no prior oauth)
2. trigger oauth flow to link account (make mention here to update the .env file)
3. move to a loading page whilst all of the transactions are being downloaded, use SSE or something to update loading
4. redirect to dashboard once data dump is compelted
NOTE: we should also re-use this for on app open sync latest data (limited to last 90 days)

Profile Page:
- include usefule information like IBAN, account, swift, etc...
- list out existing accounts
- list out any other relevant account level info
- include easy UI for copy pasting 

Settings page:
- add components for: setting monzo details (ideally let people config in app instead of env)
- option to trigger a refetch of data/refresh rate
- stretch goal: specify theme

Setup Page:
- on load if no monzo keys show page so they have to do it to login first (reuse same logic from settings page)

Electronise:
- Set up an electron build to wrap the react application for a nice desktop experiance and ability to add to toolbar

Dockerise:
- set up Dockerfiles and docker compose for other services so they can be run on backend


Clean up:
- indentation standarisation
- naming conventions/capitalisations


# Electron
- make an option to have the client react app as electron app for easy opening, and connection to hosted backend services

Unit testing:
- should start once a stable project structure is in place
