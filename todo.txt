1. add generator for mock data (should probabably be static, runs once and stores as json)
2. generate generic components for proportial area charts, and line/bar charts ideally use a library for this
3. Set up a masonary grid on the front end that supports re-sizing
4. Dive into how we handle data ranges/comparisons of data ranges both in terms of UI and data flow
5. Integrate mock data into ui and refine UI elemens (assume fixed data range of 1 week for this)
6. Set up date range specification
7. Set up date comparsion option (ie add another date to compare against)
8. integrate actual data (will need to be stored in DB most likely)
