Settings page:
- set up react router to display different content based on route
- create settings page component
- add components for: setting monzo details (ideally let people config in app instead of env)
- allow specification of local server URL the backend is hosted on (default to localhost:3000)  
- option to trigger a refetch of data/refresh rate
- stretch goal: specify theme

- on load if no monzo keys show page so they have to do it to login first (reuse same logic from settings page)
