# Problems I have in real life
- I can't easly see a chart of my spening broken down by label/payment target
- I can't see a side by side of respective weeks and months


# Overview of Monzo API

## Auth
Documentation requires oauth access token base authentication this will need to be supported in nestjs service

## Fetching 
- get accounts 
- get a balance 
- get pots 
- get transactions and get transaction

Note that: After a user has authenticated, your client can fetch all of their transactions, and after 5 minutes, it can only sync the last 90 days of transactions.
 If you need the user‚Äôs entire transaction history, you should consider fetching and storing it right after authentication.

Note: merchant list does not return a full merchent, only the merchant id, we'll likely want to store the merchant data in that case to avoid having to fetch every time

# Considerations
## Graphing
- use prometheus as the graphing tool as it's in built for this 
- use react app as the frontend with graphing ui


## Data syncing


# Use Cases

## Must 
- Ability to list aggregate spend per week setting a number of weeks going back (ie compare last 4 weeks of spending)
- 


## Should

## Could

## Wont


# UI Components

## Global range Setter
Data dog offers the ability to specify a data range that then applies to all cards
This element should allow filtering by:
- Category
- data range (this should have fast options like this week, month, year)


## Person Paid proportional area chart
displays a grid of all of the spending for the week bucketed by the target payer

## Category spent proportional area chart
dispalys a grid of all the spending for the week bucketed by the category

## Aggregated income outcome
displays 3 lines
- how much money came in this week
- how much money was spent this week
- the net of the two values
- if possible show the target spend as well


## Top list 
Displays the top elements that were spent on during a period

## Simple money in money out value for period
Displays two values red and green in and out
